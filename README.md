The website consists of two pages: the home page and the game page. The home page has a "Start Game" button that the user can click on to direct them to the main game page.

## Testing 
### Automated testing 
 There were no automated testing procedures for this project due to time constraints and a lack of experience. Although automated testing wasn't used for this project, I acknowledge the importance of using it. For example, in a real-world situation, I would use Jest in the future because it will eliminate errors and risks quickly to save time.
### Manual testing
 ### Validators
 #### jslint
 Js Lint was used for manual testing to check whether there were any errors. During the testing process, there were some errors that occurred. The screenshots are posted below to show evidence.
