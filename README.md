## Description

Zoo Match is a game where the user has a pair of eight cards to match. The game starts with a set of cards hidden on the back for the user to guess and remember. The website consists of two pages: the home page and the game page. The home page has a "Start Game" button that the user can click on to direct them to the main game page.
The instructions on how to play the game are below the home page for first-time visitors.

## Testing 
### Automated vs Manual
The key differences between automated and manual testing are , automated testing uses frameworks to run test. It is the process in which testers utilize tools and scripts to automated standard. Manual testing is very hands on it requires a group of engineers to be highly involved in every step when a test has been created to the test execution. Both have their strengths and weaknesses. For example manual testing is time-consuming, secondly depending on the size of the project, it may require a large team of people and thridly manual testing has a high error rate. On the other hand it's strength is that it handles more complex scenarios. For automated testing requires coding and test maintenance. But on the plus side, its much faster and covers many more permutations.

### Behaviour-Driven Development(BBD) & Test Driven Development (TDD)
There are a lot more ways when it comes to building and code ,Behaviour-Driven Development (BBD) and Test Driven Development (TDD). Behaviour-Driven development is based on the expected outcome of an action. BBD is manual testing this way developers would sit in front of the application and test to see its outcome. Test Driven development is a technique where tests are written first then the code. 
TDD uses the Red Green Refactor appoach were tests are made to fail first then is passed when the right of amount of code is written. Once tests are passed we then analyse ways to improve or refactor our code. 

I would use BBD because it ensures that the application works on a higher level and provides a greater level of confidence.

### Automated testing 
 There were no automated testing procedures for this project due to time constraints and a lack of experience. Although automated testing wasn't used for this project, I acknowledge the importance of using it. For example, in a real-world situation, I would use Jest which is a popluar JavaScript testing framework, it will eliminate errors and risks quickly to save time. It also ensures that different tests don't influence each other's results. 
### Manual testing
 ### Validators
 #### jslint
 Js Lint was used for manual testing to check whether there were any errors. During the testing process, there were some errors that occurred. The screenshots are posted below to show evidence.

   The property name had to be ordered alphabetical so the names had to be rearranged.

   Line of code was more than 80 characters, so I had to section parts of code.

   Jslint was unable to finish wrap.
 
  Some errors still remain and were unable to solve, here are screenshots. There are no major issues and all functions operate in order.

 #### W3C Validator and CSS Validator 
 The W3C Markup Validator and W3c CSS Validator was used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no errors. Screenshots are presented below to show solved errors. 
  
  This error occurred when testing game.html, because there was no space between the syntax. This was easily solved by seprating the html elements. 
  ![no space error](https://github.com/A-Gr33n/Milestone-Project-2-/assets/120597058/a3032452-0c4e-44fa-8e9a-2b35f0befe93)
  
  This error was shown when testing index.html (home page). The element button must not appear as a descendant of the a element.

   This error was solved by changing the a element to form element.
